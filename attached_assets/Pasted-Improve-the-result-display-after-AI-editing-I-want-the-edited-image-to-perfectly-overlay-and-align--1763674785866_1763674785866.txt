Improve the result display after AI editing. I want the edited image to perfectly overlay and align with the original image, with a movable comparison slider in the middle — left shows the original, right shows the edited version. Details to implement: Create a before-after comparison view where: The original image and edited image are perfectly aligned and the same size. A draggable vertical slider (centered by default) lets the user swipe left or right to compare. The slider should update smoothly (like Figma’s “compare” or Diffuse AI demos). Fix the Effect Strength slider: It should control the opacity or blending of the edited image layer over the original. Example: 0% = full original, 100% = full edited, mid = mix/blend. Make sure it re-renders the combined image dynamically. Ensure the edited image retains the exact same size as the original: Currently the edited result appears cropped or resized. Match the width/height to the original image. Only crop if the user’s text prompt specifically asks to crop. Fix the “Image not found” issue when switching between History → Editor: The app should persist image state or cache in local/session storage or a backend reference. Ensure image_id or image_url remains valid across route changes. Extend the UI below the Effect Strength slider: Add an “AI Suggestions” section that appears after generation. The agent should analyze the edited image and propose optional follow-up enhancements (e.g., “Add background blur”, “Enhance lighting”, “Add filter overlay”). Allow the user to apply one or chain multiple suggestions. Clarify the Regenerate button behavior: It should take the current edited image as input for refinement (iterative editing), not always restart from the original. Add a toggle if needed: “Regenerate from Original” vs. “Refine Current Edit”. Technical expectations: Ensure images load via consistent storage URLs (no 404s). Use a stable React component for the before-after slider (e.g., react-compare-slider or a custom div+range approach). Maintain aspect ratio, centered alignment, and responsive scaling. Update backend API (if necessary) to support blend factor or iterative regeneration.
