Design a modern, minimal, and intuitive web UI for an AI-powered photo editing app called Aperture AI. The app allows users to upload or take a photo, describe edits in natural language (e.g., ‘remove background and brighten the subject’), and preview AI-generated results.
Design Goals:
* Clean, modern aesthetic with subtle gradients or soft glassmorphism.
* Focus on usability, clarity, and delight — fewer distractions.
* Primary colors: neutral background (light or dark mode), with a teal or royal blue accent for action buttons.
* Rounded corners, generous spacing, and smooth shadow depth.
* Typography: sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or SF Pro), medium weight.
Key Screens to Design:
1. Home / Upload Screen:
    * App name/logo at top.
    * Upload area with drag/drop or “Select Photo” button.
    * Example prompts below (e.g., ‘Make the sky more dramatic’, ‘Remove blemishes’).
    * Floating action button: “Edit with AI”.
2. Prompt Screen:
    * Display uploaded photo preview.
    * Text field with placeholder: “Describe what you’d like to change…”
    * Suggestion chips for quick edits (“Enhance colors”, “Remove object”, “Add depth”).
    * Button: “Generate Edits”.
3. Editing / Preview Screen:
    * Split view: Before & After comparison.
    * Slider to adjust edit intensity.
    * “Accept”, “Undo”, and “Regenerate” buttons.
    * Progress bar or animated spinner while processing.
4. History / Exports Screen:
    * List of past edited photos with small thumbnails.
    * Tap to reopen or export image.
    * Simple share/export modal with options (Save, Copy Link, Share).
UI Style Inspiration:
* Apple Photos + Canva + Prisma app aesthetic.
* Rounded card components, subtle drop shadows, and dynamic light/dark themes.
* Buttons with gradient fills and micro-interactions (slight press feedback).
Deliverables:
* Frame layout for mobile (iOS or cross-platform).
* Each screen should have named components (ImagePickerCard, PromptInput, PreviewPanel, ActionBar).
* Include example UI copy and icons (upload, regenerate, download).
Optional: Add a playful mascot icon or animation when AI is “thinking.”
